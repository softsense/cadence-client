# - Targets should never, EVER be *actual source files*.
#   Always use book-keeping files in $(BUILD).
#   Otherwise e.g. changing git branches could confuse Make about what it needs to do.
# - Similarly, prerequisites should be those book-keeping files,
#   not source files that are prerequisites for book-keeping.
#   e.g. depend on .build/fmt, not $(ALL_SRC), and not both.
# - Be strict and explicit about prerequisites / order of execution / etc.
# - Test your changes with `-j 27 --output-sync` or something!
# - Test your changes with `make -d ...`!  It should be reasonable!

# temporary build products and book-keeping targets that are always good to / safe to clean.
#
# the go version is embedded in the path, so changing Go's version or arch triggers rebuilds.
# other things can be added if necessary, but hopefully only go's formatting behavior matters?
